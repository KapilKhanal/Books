# The Discipline of Machine Learning

As like any other scientific discipline, it aims to solve fundamental process of learning by machines. To quote the paper, 

`"How can we build computer systems that automatically improve with experience, and what are the fundamental laws that govern all learning processes?”`

 Mathematically, machine learns with respect to a particular task T, performance metric P, and type of experience E, if the system reliably improves its performance P at task T, following experience E. The learning task can be arbitrary as long as it has these three components.

Machine learning combines Computer Science and Statistics: Computer Science deals with “_How can we build machines that solve problems, and which problems are inherently tractable/intractable?_ While Statistics deals with, _What can be inferred from data plus a set of modeling assumptions, with what reliability?_

 This leads to a distinct area for Machine learning_,_ Machine Learning focuses on the question of how to get computers to program themselves. It is concerned with computer architectures, algorithms for capturing data, indexing data and inferring from it. In addition to that, Machine learning significantly cross breeds with techniques and concepts in psychology, economics and  biology. 

Machine learning may never be useful to do say, Matrix multiplication but any areas where you can collect data and the data represents the population and can be generalized like computer vision, natural language processing , robot control will be useful . It can be interpreted as a way of designing "intelligent "software. 

Machine learning is moving forward with a rich set of theoretical results. Below are the research questions that is moving the field ahead

* Can unlabeled data be helpful for supervised learning?
* How can we transfer what is learned for one task to improve learning in other related tasks?
* What is the relationship between different learning algorithms, and which should be used when?
* For learners that actively collect their own training data, what is the best strategy?
* To what degree can we have both data privacy and the benefits of data mining?

The big perspective of the field in coming future

* Can we build never-ending learners?
* Can machine learning theories and algorithms help explain human learning
* Can we design programming languages containing machine learning primitives?
* Will computer perception merge with machine learning?
