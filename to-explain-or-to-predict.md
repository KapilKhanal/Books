# To Predict or To Explain\(Instrumentalism vs Realism\)

## Instrumentalism vs Realism

Two different ways science is viewed philosophically

```
Realism: Realism, at the most general level, is the view that 
there are entities in this world that exist independently of our
mind. From a scientific perspective, scientific realism means 
that the world studied by science really exists and has the 
property independently of our beliefs, and that the aim of 
science is to describe and explain the world including parts of 
it that are not directly observable

```

```
Instrumentalism: Instrumentalism, on the other hand, treats
science as an instrument to explain and predict phenomena rather
than an approximation of the objective reality.

What do you think Artificial Intelligence needs, Realism or Instrumentalism?

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do we dare explain what we are predicting ?
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Why bother with realistic explanation when you can use instrumentalism  to predict and get usable result?

## Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy\_of\_artificial\_intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_artificial_intelligence)

The philosophy of artificial intelligence attempts to answer such questions as follows:

* Can a machine act intelligently? Can it solve any problem that a person would solve by thinking?
* Are human intelligence and machine intelligence the same? Is the [human brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain) essentially a computer?
* Can a machine have a [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind), mental states, and [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) in the same way that a human being can? Can it feel how things are?

Summary : In the last two decades, a highly instrumentalist form of statistical and machine learning has achieved an extraordinary success as the computational heart of the phenomenon glossed as “predictive analytics,” “data mining,” or “data science.” This instrumentalist culture of prediction emerged from subfields within applied statistics, artificial intelligence, and database management. This essay looks at representative developments within computational statistics and pattern recognition from the 1950s onward, in the United States and beyond, central to the explosion of algorithms, techniques, and epistemic values that ultimately came together in the data sciences of today. 

Leo Breiman described “two cultures” of using statistical models “to reach conclusions from data.” The first “assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model.” The second “uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanisms as unknown

Two ways statistics is done. “Generative model of induction”,where “an understanding of how data are generated reflects an understanding of the corresponding law of nature.” In data sets with high numbers of dimensions, such approaches turned out to fail. “The predictive \(discriminative\) models of induction”, In such an approach, “they are just looking for a function that explains the data best.The generative approach is realist, and the predictive one, instrumentalist. This Engineering culture of instrumental approach, moreover, “played a crucial role in the success that pattern recognition technology has achieved.
