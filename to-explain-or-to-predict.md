# To Explain or To Predict\(Instrumentalism vs Realism\)

## Instrumentalism vs Realism

Two different ways science is viewed philosophically

```
Realism: Realism, at the most general level, is the view that 
there are entities in this world that exist independently of our
mind. From a scientific perspective, scientific realism means 
that the world studied by science really exists and has the 
property independently of our beliefs, and that the aim of 
science is to describe and explain the world including parts of 
it that are not directly observable

```

```
Instrumentalism: Instrumentalism, on the other hand, treats
science as an instrument to explain and predict phenomena rather
than an approximation of the objective reality.
```

Do you think Artificial Intelligence needs Realism or Instrumentalism?
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do we dare explain what we are predicting ?
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Why bother with realistic explanation when you can use instrumentalism  to predict and get usable result? 
{% endhint %}

## Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy\_of\_artificial\_intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_artificial_intelligence)

The philosophy of artificial intelligence attempts to answer such questions as follows:

* Can a machine act intelligently? Can it solve any problem that a person would solve by thinking?
* Are human intelligence and machine intelligence the same? Is the [human brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain) essentially a computer?
* Can a machine have a [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind), mental states, and [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) in the same way that a human being can? Can it feel how things are?
