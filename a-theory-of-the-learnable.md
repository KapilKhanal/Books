# A Theory of the Learnable

This paper revolves around the idea of what could be called as learning? learnable tasks? and Programming. So it was succinctly defined as the _phenomenon of knowledge acquisition in the absence of explicit programming._ 

 From a computational point of view, how can this phenomenon be studied. Author presents the framework/methodology as following

* [ ] Information Gathering mechanism
* [ ] Learning protocol that can be terminated in a reasonable number of steps

> The problem is to discover good models that are interesting to study for their own sake and that promise to be relevant both to explaining human experience and to building devices that can learn.
