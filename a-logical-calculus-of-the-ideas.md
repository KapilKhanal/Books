# A Logical Calculus of the Ideas

This paper could be an Initial neural network paper.This could be regarded as the first use of computation to model Mind and Brain. They use Turing machines computational Notion.  Neurons either fire in response of stimulus or it doesn't fire. Taking this concept, this paper proposes that all the neural events and the relations among them could be described or "modeled" by propositional logic i.e series of True or False statements and their interaction. This paper is loosely inspired by the mechanism of neurons. The Authors tried to formulate the theory of nervous activities from other author in terms of formal logic and propositions.

The paper went on to talk about neural networks with and without circles or loops. They showed that a certain class of neurons that satisfy simple logical relations between propositions a can be combined  to satisfy more complex logical relations. So, McCulloch and Pittsâ€™s nets are logic gates and combinations of logic gates which are found in digital computer nowadays. With the analogy of excitatory and inhibitory response in neurons they paved a way to more research on computation and as a result finite automata was developed later by other researchers.

They ended their paper saying that their research helps to make a tool to construct the hypothetical  nets of required properties. As a result of their paper following assumptions were implicitly accepted by the community which in a way paved a way for today's AI:

* Brain as a computational net.
* Use of computations to describe brain
* Every neural activity is a computation.

Other branches of mathematics were used to study brain but this paper changed the course to describing brain from a computational point of view.
