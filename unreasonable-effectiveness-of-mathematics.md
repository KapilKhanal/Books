# Unreasonable effectiveness  of Mathematics

Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.                      - BERTRAND RUSSELL, Study of Mathematics

Wigner begins his paper with belief that mathematical concepts have uses far beyond than what they were originally developed for. Mathematical concepts turn up on the entirely unrelated areas. Like, in the story mentioned in the paper. Pi comes up in a study of population. Another thought experiment paper suggests is what if you are given bunch of keys for different doors. You notice that mostly on first try or at least on second try you were able to open the door. Is there any kind of relation between keys and doors. The point author wants to make is whether or not if any phenomenon or theory expressed in Mathematics is reliable at all? Also, why is mathematics so damn good at explaining natural science phenomenon.

Author explains fundamental questions like "What is Mathematics?","What is Physics?". Author explains how statements in mathematics act as tool to describe the concepts in Physics.Physics chooses certain mathematical concepts for the formulation of the laws of nature.Concepts of mathematics are not chosen for their conceptual simplicity - even sequences of pairs of numbers are far from being the simplest concepts - but for their amenability to clever manipulations and to striking, brilliant arguments.

The laws of nature like those that were based on simple empricial observation like Newtons laws but we know when they were formulated mathematically , we now can work on curve surfaces and higher dimension which are beyond human intuition and empirical observation. Author gives several similar example like elementary quantum mechanics and how is so closely related to the matrices operation defined in mathematics. 

To end:The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. We should be grateful for it and hope that it will remain valid in future research and that it will extend, for better or for worse, to our pleasure, even though perhaps also to our bafflement, to wide branches of learning
