  I will read several research papers and I will write summaries here in a way a
  15 year would understand.This might sound like blah blah blah...But I strongly
  believe it's a good start.

# Overview

## Why?

When a 15 year old cares more about the research papers and research methodology , then the critical thinking skills will start to serve the society. Reading research papers are only sure way to increase the maturity required to do the research

![I will try to read research paper on this sequence ](.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2018-12-31-at-9.15.38-pm.png)

The research paper that introduced concepts are used in modern industry will be covered more than older research papers

Since, I already had a University level Machine learning and Statistical learning course, I have more background to start reading machine learning but that doesn't mean you shouldn't start reading research paper. This is why i usually keep it non math, more intuitive style. Being a Math major too, I struggle with all this math. But the end goal of AI is intuition. Every fancy Math theorem, tricks are used so that AI/program will behave like a rational human. I believe starting with "summary" of research papers and grabbing a good book that covers the most of those research paper will formally get you into ML research community. This is what i think and that's why i started this "Book"

> Nothing on these papers are my work. All credits are to authors of those papers.I am reading those and write as i understood. So, it's always wise decision to read those original works. These summaries are like fast food. Quick but i don't guarantee wellbeing of health.

> I would like to thank these authors for doing these wonderful work for humanity!
