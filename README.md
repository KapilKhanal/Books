  I will read several research papers and i will write summaries here in a way a
  15 year would understand.This might sound like blah blah blah...But i strongly
  believe it's a good start.

# Overview

## Why?

When a 15 year old cares more about the research papers and research methodology than kardashians or pew dii pew\(whatever!\), then the critical thinking skills will start to serve the society. Reading research papers are only sure way to increase the maturity required to do the research

The research paper that introduced concepts are used in modern industry will be covered more than older research papers

Since, I already had a University level Machine learning and Statistical learning course, I have more background to start reading machine learning but that doesn't mean you shouldn't start reading research paper. This is why i usually keep it non math, more intuitive style. Being a Math major too, I struggle with all this math. But the end goal of AI is intuition. Every fancy Math theorem, tricks are used so that AI/program will behave like a rational human. I believe starting with "summary" of research papers and grabbing a good book that covers the most of those research paper will formally keep you ahead of the ML research community. This is what i think and that's why i started this "Book"
